Chicken Meat Classification using MobileNetV2

The chicken meat images were captured at a local chicken dressing plant in General Santos City, Philippines.
Captured images were divided into healthy and defect categories. The defect category is divided into two subcategories, Broken and Hematoma.
These images underwent data augmentation to increase variety.
Dataset was then trained in Jupyter using MobileNetV2 as its model.
The model was fine-tuned up to 40 epochs.
The Healthy and Defect classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.96 while the Broken and Hematoma classification model reached 0.80.
112 out of 115 images were correctly classified as Healthy.
84 out of 90 images were correctly classified as Defect.
